**State Management**

**GetX**

I leverage GetX for efficient state management, navigation, and dependency injection in my projects. The clean and concise syntax of GetX allows me to build robust and maintainable applications.

**Riverpod**

I also use Riverpod for state management, taking advantage of its declarative approach and the ability to manage complex application states effectively.
